* <mark style="color:green;">**BE ON A NEW ACCOUNT FOR THE MAXIMUM SUCCESS RATE**</mark>

<summary><strong>WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ON A NEW ACCOUNT?</strong></summary>

We recommend you open a new account just to be safe and not risk all your hard work. Going on your main account, which you've been kicked on before, brings potential risks, and we do not recommend it generally. <mark style="color:orange;">**We are also not responsible if you do.**</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Notice:** You can log in to your Epic Games account, even if youâ€™ve been kicked or banned, to play games like ARK or GTA V without additional risk, and then switch back.\
\
However, for RUST, <mark style="color:red;">**this is not recommended**</mark> to log back into a Steam account from which you were banned. Doing so may result in additional server bans for "ban evasion", which is a pain in the ass.
