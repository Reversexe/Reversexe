<summary><strong>WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ON A NEW ACCOUNT?</strong> ðŸŽ­</summary>

It is advisable to open a new account to ensure security and protect your spoof. Using your primary (main) account, especially if it has faced issues before (like kicks), carries potential risks. <mark style="color:orange;">**Please note that we cannot assume responsibility if you choose to proceed with this - Refund rights expire too.**</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Notice:** You can log in to your Epic Games account, even if youâ€™ve been kicked or banned, to play games like ARK or GTA V, Fivem, without additional risk, and then switch back. (We don't recommend playing Fortnite on an old account)\
\
For **RUST**, <mark style="color:red;">**logging back into a Steam account from which you were banned is not recommended**</mark>. Doing so may result in additional server bans for "ban evasion".
