<summary><strong>WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ON A NEW ACCOUNT?</strong></summary>

We recommend you to be on a new account just to be safe and not to risk all your hard work. Going on your main account you've been kicked on before brings potential risks with it & we do not recommend it generally. <mark style="color:orange;">**We are also not responsible in case you do.**</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Notice:** You can log in to your Epic Games account, even if youâ€™ve been kicked or banned, to play games like ARK or GTA V without additional risk.\
\
However, for RUST, <mark style="color:red;">**this is not recommended**</mark> to log back into a Steam account from which you were banned. Doing so may result in additional server bans for "ban evasion".
