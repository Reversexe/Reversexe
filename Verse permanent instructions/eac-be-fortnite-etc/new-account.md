<summary><strong>WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ON A NEW ACCOUNT?</strong></summary>

_We recommend you to be on a new account just to be safe and not to risk all your hard work. Going on your main account you've been kicked on before brings potential risks with it & we do not recommend it generally. <mark style="color:orange;">**We are also not responsible in case you do.**</mark>_

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**NOTE:** It is possible to log in to your Epic account you've been kicked or banned on before to play other games such as ARK, GTA V, and more. That is fine and involves no risks._\
\
_For <mark style="color:orange;">**RUST**</mark>_ _<mark style="color:orange;">**this is not recommended.**</mark> You are not allowed to get on your previous Steam account you've been banned on RUST. You will be banned for "evading" in servers, which is a pain in the ass._
