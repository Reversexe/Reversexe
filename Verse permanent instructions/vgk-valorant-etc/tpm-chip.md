<summary><mark style="color:green;background-color:green;"><strong>#3 TPM BYPASS (BEST CHOICE/PERMANENT)</strong></mark></summary>

\
&#xNAN;**#1** Purchase a new TPM Chip <mark style="background-color:blue;">**(Make sure fTPM is disabled in BIOS before installation)**</mark>\
\
&#xNAN;**#2** Make sure it is suitable with ur motherboard (we won't help with that)\
\
&#xNAN;**#3** Install the new TPM chip before downloading Valorant, after woofing.\
\
**Installation difficulty:** <mark style="color:yellow;">**5/10 |**</mark>**&#x20;Average Price:&#x20;**<mark style="color:yellow;">**$15**</mark>\
\ <mark style="color:yellow;">**The installation is not difficult. Make sure to purchase one that works with ur motherboard. Do a little research to find out with ease.**</mark> ‚úÖ\

\
This is the best, most future-proof solution for legitimate players **since any 'bypass' can eventually and unfortunately become detected/patched at some point.** A TPM Chip is therefore the best solution for a lot of people, and really your only choice if no other bypasses work and you really want to get unbanned from Valorant.
