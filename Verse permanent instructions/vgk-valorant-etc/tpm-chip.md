# üîê TPM CHIP

{% hint style="success" %}
**TPM \[Trusted Computing Module]** üîê\
\
<mark style="color:red;">**Vanguard Anti-cheat**</mark> abuses the TPM chip. Verse has multiple fixes for this. Please attempt them in order from **BYPASS #1** (**2** optional, based on preference), and at the end, **BYPASS #3, if none worked.**\
\
<mark style="background-color:purple;">**USE BYPASS #4 ONLY IF YOU TRIED ALL 3 OTHER BYPASSES BEFORE.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

<summary><mark style="background-color:blue;"><strong>#1 TPM BYPASS (TRY ME FIRST)</strong></mark></summary>

\
**#1** Make sure TPM is <mark style="color:red;">**DISABLED**</mark>.\
\
**#2** Install [https://one.one.one.one/](https://one.one.one.one/) and connect to it (WARP)\
\
**#3** Open Valorant while being connected to WARP, on a fresh account.\
\
_This is the most simple bypass. <mark style="color:red;">**This bypass will not work for everyone**</mark>, however, it is recommended to attempt this bypass first before you use the other ones._

<summary><mark style="color:green;background-color:green;"><strong>#3 TPM BYPASS (BEST CHOICE/PERMANENT)</strong></mark></summary>

\
**#1** Purchase a new TPM Chip <mark style="background-color:blue;">**(Make sure fTPM is disabled in BIOS before installation)**</mark>\
\
**#2** Make sure it is suitable with ur motherboard (we won't help with that)\
\
**#3** Install the new TPM chip before downloading Valorant, after woofing.\
\
**Installation difficulty:** <mark style="color:yellow;">**5/10 |**</mark>** Average Price: **<mark style="color:yellow;">**$15**</mark>\
\ <mark style="color:yellow;">**The installation is not difficult. Make sure to purchase one that works with ur motherboard. Do a little research to find out with ease.**</mark>\
\
_This is the best, most future-proof solution for legitimate players **since any 'bypass' can eventually and unfortunately become detected/patched at some point.** A TPM Chip is therefore the best solution for a lot of people, and really your only choice if no other bypasses work and you really want to get unbanned from Valorant._
